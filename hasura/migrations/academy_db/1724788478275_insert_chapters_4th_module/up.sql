For the first time, by leveraging blockchain\'s transparency and immutability, artists could create non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to represent long-form generative pieces, ensuring provenance and ownership.\n\nThe rise of blockchain-based NFT platforms further fueled this intersection, providing a marketplace for collectors to acquire and trade these unique digital assets. This convergence has offered artists new opportunities for monetization and audience engagement while revolutionizing the way we perceive, value, and interact with generative art.\n\n### Cryptokitties, Punks & Autoglyphs\nWe can trace the origins of blockchain-based generative art in 2017, when Cryptokitties introduced the concept of unique, collectible digital assets (NFTs) that were algorithmically generated with distinct traits, showcasing the potential of generative algorithms in creating rare and individualized digital artworks.\n\nSimilarly, CryptoPunks, also launched in 2017, became pioneers in the NFT space, featuring 10,000 unique, algorithmically generated pixel art characters. Initially given away for free, they quickly gained popularity due to their distinctiveness and scarcity, attracting collectors and investors alike.\n\nTheir success demonstrated the potential of digital ownership and blockchain technology, influencing the broader art and crypto communities. By popularizing the concept of verifiable digital assets, CryptoPunks played a crucial role in the explosion of the NFT market, leading to widespread adoption and the creation of countless other digital art and collectible projects.\n\nWhile Cryptokitties and CryptoPunks may be considered collectibles rather than art by many, Autoglyphs, introduced in 2019, expanded upon these concepts, generating digital artworks directly on the blockchain using Ethereum smart contracts, showcasing the intersection of generative art and decentralized technology.\n\nThese projects sparked widespread interest in blockchain-based art and demonstrated the power of generative algorithms in creating unique, verifiable, and tradable digital assets.\n\n### OpenSea\nInspired by the success of Cryptokitties, and envisioning a new market for NFTs demand, OpenSea launched in December 2017 and played a pivotal role in popularizing online art trading by providing a user-friendly marketplace for buying, selling, and trading digital art assets, including NFTs.\n\nOpenSea and many other platforms democratized access to art, enabling artists to reach a global audience and collectors to discover and acquire unique digital artworks easily.\n\nOpenSea\'s robust infrastructure and wide range of supported formats, from images and videos to 3D models and virtual worlds, catered to diverse artistic practices, fueling the growth of the digital art market. Its integration with blockchain technology ensured transparency, security, and provenance, instilling trust and confidence among artists and collectors alike.', null, E'Art on the blockchain', E'991383898', E'2024-08-27T19:52:20.473108+00:00', E'2024-08-27T19:52:20.473108+00:00', E'5c1213f8-6946-451c-92be-7ed9e14e9d85', E'c5a014db-7995-4cb6-8514-2377f5d47988', null, null);

With long-form generative art, and blind minting, this meant that algorithms had to become a lot more battle-tested and ready to be minted in the hundreds, sometimes even thousands with all potential outputs falling within the artist’s scope and intentions.\n\nThis shift represents a departure from traditional static artworks, emphasizing variability, and the exploration of emergent behaviors. Long-form generative art offers a new paradigm for artistic expression, often inviting audiences to participate in the co-creation of ever-changing and evolving digital worlds.\n\n### Art Blocks\nThe launch of Art Blocks by Snowfro in late 2020, elevated generative art to the forefront by providing a curated platform for artists to showcase their algorithmically generated creations as non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nThis spotlight attracted a surge of interest from artists eager to explore the creative possibilities of generative algorithms, collectors seeking unique and dynamic digital artworks, and curators recognizing the innovative potential of algorithmic art.\n\nArt Blocks\' success in fostering a vibrant ecosystem for generative art not only amplified the visibility and appreciation of this genre but also spurred collaborations, exhibitions, and discussions that further propelled its popularity across the art world.\n\nWith Art Blocks, the concept of long-form generative art, a term coined by Tyler Hobbs, was introduced and the way generative art was created by artists changed forever.\n\n### Tezos\nWhile ArtBlocks collections due to the popularity of their artists as well as the high minting costs on Ethereum ended up being aimed at high-end collectors, a mix of upcoming and established artists sought the inexpensiveness and pro-experimentation feel that different platforms and communities provided on the Tezos blockchain.\n\nA wonderful group of artists started releasing their art on platforms like Hic et Nunc, Objkt and fxHash which, by being open to all, helped democratize release mechanisms and communities to all artists.\n\n### Galleries, events & community\nBeyond Art Blocks and Tezos, we have seen so much variety of galleries, curators, collector communities and art-focused events that have emerged in these past years to help foster the generative art movement forward.\n\nSome stand outs could be Bright Moments with their itinerant cities exhibitions, Le Random, that has become an institution in their efforts to foster knowledge around generative art or Flamingo DAO, a group of collectors and curators focused on a creative an extensive collection of artworks. And there are so many, many more.\n\n### What’s to come\nWhile since 2021, the spotlight for generative art has been all about blockchain and long-form collections, we are starting to see artists who are going back to more traditional ways as well as exploring alternative ways to release art.\n\nTwo of the most prominent ways in which we are seeing these changes are in the form of curated collections, where the artist pre-selects the array of outputs to make it to their final artwork, and co-creative art where the final outputs of a collection need of collector’s interaction, be it through curation or through interaction, to manifest.', null, E'Long-form generative art', E'991384201', E'2024-08-27T19:53:45.63916+00:00', E'2024-08-27T19:53:45.63916+00:00', E'de689e53-86f0-4da9-961b-d588fa2e86c7', E'c5a014db-7995-4cb6-8514-2377f5d47988', null, E'5c1213f8-6946-451c-92be-7ed9e14e9d85');
