Long-form generative art offers a new paradigm for artistic expression, often inviting audiences to participate in the co-creation of ever-changing and evolving digital worlds.\n\n### Art Blocks\nThe launch of Art Blocks by Snowfro in late 2020, elevated generative art to the forefront by providing a curated platform for artists to showcase their algorithmically generated creations as non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nThis spotlight attracted a surge of interest from artists eager to explore the creative possibilities of generative algorithms, collectors seeking unique and dynamic digital artworks, and curators recognizing the innovative potential of algorithmic art.\n\nArt Blocks\' success in fostering a vibrant ecosystem for generative art not only amplified the visibility and appreciation of this genre but also spurred collaborations, exhibitions, and discussions that further propelled its popularity across the art world.\n\nWith Art Blocks, the concept of long-form generative art, a term coined by Tyler Hobbs, was introduced and the way generative art was created by artists changed forever.\n\n### Tezos\nWhile ArtBlocks collections due to the popularity of their artists as well as the high minting costs on Ethereum ended up being aimed at high-end collectors, a mix of upcoming and established artists sought the inexpensiveness and pro-experimentation feel that different platforms and communities provided on the Tezos blockchain.\n\nA wonderful group of artists started releasing their art on platforms like Hic et Nunc, Objkt and fxHash which, by being open to all, helped democratize release mechanisms and communities to all artists.\n\n### Galleries, events & community\nBeyond Art Blocks and Tezos, we have seen so much variety of galleries, curators, collector communities and art-focused events that have emerged in these past years to help foster the generative art movement forward.\n\nSome stand outs could be Bright Moments with their itinerant cities exhibitions, Le Random, that has become an institution in their efforts to foster knowledge around generative art or Flamingo DAO, a group of collectors and curators focused on a creative an extensive collection of artworks. And there are so many, many more.\n\n### What’s to come\nWhile since 2021, the spotlight for generative art has been all about blockchain and long-form collections, we are starting to see artists who are going back to more traditional ways as well as exploring alternative ways to release art.\n\nTwo of the most prominent ways in which we are seeing these changes are in the form of curated collections, where the artist pre-selects the array of outputs to make it to their final artwork, and co-creative art where the final outputs of a collection need of collector’s interaction, be it through curation or through interaction, to manifest.', null, E'Long-form generative art', E'991384201', E'2024-08-27T19:53:45.63916+00:00', E'2024-08-27T19:53:45.63916+00:00', E'de689e53-86f0-4da9-961b-d588fa2e86c7', E'c5a014db-7995-4cb6-8514-2377f5d47988', null, E'5c1213f8-6946-451c-92be-7ed9e14e9d85');

These algorithms may incorporate elements of randomness, automation, or rule-based procedures to generate artwork that is unique, unpredictable, and often interactive.\n\nGenerative art can take various forms, including visual art, music, literature, and multimedia installations. It often blurs the boundaries between the artist\'s intent and the emergent properties of the algorithm, inviting viewers to explore themes of creativity, authorship, and the relationship between humans and machines.\n\nGenerative art is characterized by its dynamic, evolving nature, with each iteration or instantiation of the algorithm producing a new and potentially unexpected outcome.\n\n### Styles in Generative Art\nGenerative art is not a homogenous artistic style but rather a movement where artists use similar techniques and tools encompassing a wide range of styles and approaches, each characterized by its unique aesthetic, conceptual framework, and technical implementation.\n\n- **Algorithmic Abstraction**: This style focuses on creating abstract compositions using mathematical algorithms and computational processes. Artists in this style often explore geometric forms, patterns, and textures, employing algorithms to generate intricate and visually striking artworks.\n\n- **Organic Generative Art**: This style draws inspiration from natural phenomena, biological processes, and organic forms. Artists in this style may use algorithms to simulate growth, evolution, or organic behavior, resulting in artworks that resemble living organisms, landscapes, or ecosystems.\n\n- **Narrative Generative Art**: This approach involves using algorithms to generate stories, poetry, or textual narratives. Artists in this style may employ techniques such as natural language processing or procedural storytelling to create dynamic and interactive narratives that evolve over time.\n\n- **Audiovisual Generative Art**: These styles focus on audiovisual experiences, such as algorithmic music and generative video art. These styles explore the intersection of sound, image, and algorithmic processes, often creating immersive and synesthetic experiences for viewers.\n\n- **Traditional Influences**: Generative art can also be influenced by traditional artistic movements, such as surrealism, minimalism, or abstract expressionism. Artists may use algorithms to explore and reinterpret these artistic styles, creating contemporary interpretations that blend traditional techniques with computational methods.\n\nOverall, the diversity of generative art styles reflects the creative potential of algorithmic processes and the infinite possibilities of computational creativity. From abstract compositions to organic simulations to interactive narratives, generative art offers a rich and varied landscape for exploration and expression in the digital age.\n\n### Uniqueness and Variation\nOne of the defining features of generative art is its ability to produce unique and unpredictable outcomes. Each instantiation of the algorithm results in a new iteration of the artwork, offering endless possibilities for variation and exploration. This emphasis on uniqueness challenges traditional notions of reproducibility and authenticity in art, inviting viewers to appreciate the dynamic and evolving nature of generative creations.\n\n### Interactive and Participatory\nGenerative art often encourages interactivity and participation, inviting viewers to engage with the artwork in real-time or influence its evolution. Whether through interactive installations, generative music performances, or participatory digital experiences, generative art blurs the boundaries between creator and audience, fostering a dynamic and collaborative relationship between humans and machines.\n\n### Conceptual and Philosophical Implications\nBeyond its aesthetic and technical aspects, generative art raises important conceptual and philosophical questions about creativity, authorship, and the nature of art itself. By delegating creative decision-making to algorithms, generative art challenges traditional notions of artistic authorship and the role of human agency in the creative process. It also prompts reflections on the relationship between humans and technology, exploring themes of control, unpredictability, and the boundaries of artistic expression.', null, E'What is generative art?', E'990745997', E'2024-08-27T20:51:46.030916+00:00', E'2024-08-27T20:51:46.030916+00:00', E'c88ce423-43c8-4540-9558-a74b499d134f', E'3c863d7e-cf4c-4dfd-8c98-fa117cee3908', null, null);

Do you have an understanding of how code and algorithms work? What about other methods to create generative art? Let’s find out!\n\n### How is Generative Art Created?\n\nGenerative art is created using algorithms, which are sets of rules or procedures that determine how the artwork is generated. The process begins with conceptualization, where the artist explores themes, concepts, or visual elements they want to incorporate.\n\nNext, the artist writes the code for a generative algorithm that outlines the rules and parameters for generating the artwork. Using programming languages or creative coding platforms, the artist implements the algorithm, iterating and experimenting with different configurations to explore visual possibilities. The artist constantly evaluates the artwork and makes adjustments as needed to achieve the desired outcome. Once the algorithm is refined, the artist generates the artwork, which may be displayed digitally or in physical formats.\n\nFinally, the artwork is presented to an audience through exhibitions, galleries, or online platforms, and may be distributed as digital files or NFTs for collectors to own and trade. Throughout this process, the artist engages in a creative dialogue with the algorithm, pushing the boundaries of creativity and embracing the element of randomness inherent in generative art.\n\n### Coding and Recipes\n\nImagine you want to bake a batch of chocolate chip cookies. The recipe outlines the steps you need to follow and the ingredients you\'ll need to use. Each step in the recipe corresponds to a specific action you need to take, such as mixing the ingredients, shaping the dough, and baking the cookies.\n\nCoding is like writing down the recipe for the cookies in a precise and detailed manner. Now, think of algorithms as the instructions within the recipe. Each instruction represents a logical step in the baking process. For example, one algorithm might be to preheat the oven to a specific temperature, while another algorithm might be to mix the dry ingredients together in a bowl. These algorithms break down the overall baking process into smaller, manageable steps. In the end, even from one cookie batch, every cookie will be slightly different from one another.\n\n### Algorithms in Generative Art\n\nAlgorithms need to be precise and well-defined to ensure the desired outcome. But while in other sectors code must always reproduce consistently, in generative art the beauty is in the ranges that these instructions allow for. In essence, the code in generative art dances around the instructions that execute always in the same consistent manner and the options that allow for changes render to render.\n\nVariability in generative algorithms is akin to a cookie recipe allowing for a range of toppings from chocolate chips to raisins or different cooking methods to be defined by.\n\nThe more complex the system is, the more emergence we will be able to observe in its outcome and is what by design makes generative art interesting. This diversity is the reason why today we find so many long-form generative art collections where a visual concept is explored to its maximum depth.\n\n### Generative Art Can Also Be Created by Hand\n\nGenerative art can also be created by hand by defining a set of written rules that someone has to manually follow or execute. For instance, since 1969, Sol Lewitt created a series of instructions, called “Wall Drawings,” that gave detailed steps for art installers to draw on a wall following Lewitt’s words. Although the artist conveyed the idea, he had no say in the actual execution, which could have had varying results depending on the hand executing the instructions.', null, E'What is an algorithm?', E'991377798', E'2024-08-27T21:02:12.478+00:00', E'2024-08-27T21:02:12.478+00:00', E'df7ba392-86a7-442f-84ab-f146cddd0cbc', E'3c863d7e-cf4c-4dfd-8c98-fa117cee3908', null, E'c88ce423-43c8-4540-9558-a74b499d134f');

So, why has the emergence of NFTs led to an explosion of the generative movement/ecosystem?\n\n### How NFTs Work\n\nNFTs, or Non-Fungible Tokens, are digital assets that represent ownership or proof of authenticity of unique items such as artworks, music, videos, and in-game items. Unlike cryptocurrencies, which are fungible and can be exchanged on a one-to-one basis, NFTs are unique and different from one another.\n\nNFTs are typically stored on a blockchain, which could be described as a decentralized and tamper-proof database, providing transparency, security, and immutability. NFTs have opened up new creative and commercial possibilities for artists and other creators, enabling them to tokenize and monetize their digital creations in the digital age.\n\n### Smart Contracts\n\nNFTs are powered by smart contracts, which automate various functions such as royalties, resale rights, and distribution of proceeds. The smart contract contains the logic and rules governing the minting, ownership, and transfer of NFTs, including functions for creating new tokens, transferring ownership, and enforcing royalties.\n\nSmart contracts are immutable, which means that once they’ve been stored on the blockchain, they can’t be changed. They are distributed, validated by blockchain participants, transparent, visible to everyone, and secure through encrypted data. Artists will either use their own smart contract or publish their artwork on a platform/marketplace and use their smart contracts. An artwork’s algorithm will be stored on a blockchain and as part of the smart contract logic, referenced when minting individual artworks/NFTs as the rendering element of the artwork.\n\n### The Hash\n\nThe hash associated with a generative art output enables deterministic generation, verification of authenticity, preservation of scarcity and rarity, and promotes transparency and trust within the digital art market. It serves as a crucial component in ensuring the reproducibility and authenticity of generative art editions. When a hash is used to run an artwork’s algorithm, the corresponding output will be rendered on a browser.\n\n### Traits\n\nMany platforms/marketplaces allow for collection filtering through artwork traits. Traits are parameters that define visual/conceptual elements of a particular output from a collection. Although traits are not an elemental part of a generative artwork and usually not part of the algorithm, it has become commonplace for artists to include categories of traits like palettes and geometrically distinctive aspects of the artwork as an easier way to access/explore the art.\n\n### The Browser\n\nBrowsers enable generative art to become interactive experiences, as artists can develop web-based applications and installations that respond to user input in real-time. This engagement transforms viewers into active participants, blurring the lines between creator and audience.\n\nReal-time rendering capabilities offered by browsers allow for dynamic and evolving visual experiences, empowering artists to create immersive artworks that adapt to changing conditions or user interactions.\n\nAdditionally, the abundance of web-based tools, libraries, and frameworks within browsers facilitates the creation process, providing artists with resources to experiment with algorithms, visualization techniques, and creative coding practices without the need for specialized software or hardware.\n\nFurthermore, the cross-platform compatibility of browsers ensures that generative art can be experienced across a wide range of devices, enhancing its accessibility and reach.\n\n### A New Paradigm\n\nOverall, NFTs have revolutionized the way generative art is created, owned, and traded in the digital age. They have provided artists with new opportunities for monetization and exposure, while empowering collectors to own and invest in digital artworks with confidence.\n\nAs a result, generative art has experienced a renaissance, with artists exploring new creative possibilities and pushing the boundaries of what is possible in the digital realm.', null, E'NFTs & generative art', E'991378313', E'2024-08-27T21:30:33.184287+00:00', E'2024-08-27T21:30:33.184287+00:00', E'7cf010fd-c614-4900-8e59-5d494b465aee', E'3c863d7e-cf4c-4dfd-8c98-fa117cee3908', null, E'df7ba392-86a7-442f-84ab-f146cddd0cbc');

Let’s see what sets them apart.\n\n### Algorithmic Creativity\n\nBoth styles involve the use of algorithms to create content autonomously. While generative art relies on algorithms designed, generally coded, by human artists to produce visual, auditory, or interactive artworks, generative AI employs algorithms trained on data, usually by giving the machine a text or visual input, to generate content such as images, text, or music.\n\n### Exploration of Patterns and Structure\n\nBoth explore patterns and structures, but in different contexts. Generative art often explores aesthetic patterns and compositions, while generative AI uses the patterns in sets of data to generate outputs that mimic or extend upon the input the artist gives the machine.\n\n### Automation and Autonomy\n\nBoth generative art and generative AI operate autonomously to some extent. While generative art is guided by predefined rules and algorithms crafted by artists, it still allows for autonomous creation once these rules are set. Similarly, generative AI autonomously generates content based on patterns learned from data, with minimal human intervention after the training phase. Results are unknown but somewhat expected.\n\n### Innovation and Creativity\n\nBoth domains represent innovative approaches to creativity. Generative art challenges traditional notions of artistic creation by leveraging computational tools and algorithms often reaching results impossible to replicate by hand, while generative AI expands the boundaries of creative expression by enabling machines to generate content autonomously with fast-paced iterations and evolution.\n\n### Style\n\nWhile generative art has evolved from abstract expressionism, op art, and minimalism and will generally present itself through lines and geometry, generative AI will often spawn from digitally evolving photographs, photorealistic renderings, and hyperrealism.\n\n### The Best of Both Worlds\n\nIt is relevant to highlight that these two artistic movements don’t exist in complete isolation. There are a few artists, like Sofia Crespo, Mario Klingemann, or Anna Ridler, that combine the best of both worlds by writing the algorithms that will then be used in machine learning to create the final artworks.', null, E'Generative (code) art vs generative AI art', E'991379500', E'2024-08-27T21:48:48.392253+00:00', E'2024-08-27T21:48:48.392253+00:00', E'c95f74a1-b210-4b6d-86db-96caf8bf8ff8', E'3c863d7e-cf4c-4dfd-8c98-fa117cee3908', null, E'7cf010fd-c614-4900-8e59-5d494b465aee');
