By challenging traditional notions of authorship and control, the Surrealists inspired later generations of artists to explore new ways of harnessing randomness and procedural techniques in the creative process, leading to the emergence of generative art as a distinct movement.\n\n### Early Computer Art\nThe emergence of computers in the mid-20th century provided artists with new tools for creating art. Artists like Ben Laposky and Frieder Nake experimented with early computer technologies to create algorithmic art, paving the way for the development of generative art.\n\nThe first computer-generated artwork is often attributed to Ben Laposky in the late 1940s. He created abstract geometric patterns called "Oscillons" using an oscilloscope, manipulating electron beams manually. Though not created with a digital computer, Laposky\'s work is considered the earliest form of electronic art.\n\nNake explored the use of computer algorithms to generate visual compositions, emphasizing the systematic and procedural nature of artistic creation. His experiments with code-based processes laid the foundation for later developments in generative art, inspiring artists to explore the potential of computational methods for creative expression.', null, E'Algorithms and computers', E'991379849', E'2024-08-27T18:04:10.284926+00:00', E'2024-08-27T18:04:10.284926+00:00', E'e56c1ca9-bb2b-4205-8313-e5165a886bed', E'4c02988e-e748-4fab-b0e4-fbcb50d063b9', null, null);

Coined by artist Jean-Pierre Hébert, the term "Algorists" refers to artists who employ algorithms as a primary means of generating their artworks.\n\nThey wrote the first manifesto that helped give a definition to the practice of generative art which can be summed up as “artists who create an object of art with a process that includes their own algorithms are identified as algorists”.\n\nAlgorist artists explored the intersection of art and mathematics, often creating visually striking and conceptually rich compositions through computational methods. Their work challenged traditional notions of artistic authorship and creativity, emphasizing the role of algorithms and procedural systems in the creative process.\n\nThe Algorists played a significant role in establishing generative art as a distinct movement within contemporary art, influencing subsequent generations of artists and shaping the discourse around art, technology, and computation.\n\n### Digital Revolution\nThe widespread availability of personal computers and software tools in the 1980s and 1990s democratized and had a profound impact on the creation of generative art, ushering in a new era of creative possibilities and accessibility.\n\nThe rise of the Internet and digital culture, together with advances in interactive technology and real-time processing capabilities, facilitated the exchange of ideas and resources among artists as well as enabling the possibility for immersive and generative artworks to appear in the scene.\n\nArtists like Vera Molnar, Manfred Mohr or Harold Cohen played significant roles in advancing the field of generative art during the digital revolution, demonstrating the creative potential of computational processes and algorithmic systems. Their work continues to inspire artists and researchers to explore new frontiers in the intersection of art, technology, and computation.', null, E'The growth of an artistic movement', E'991382604', E'2024-08-27T18:10:17.352324+00:00', E'2024-08-27T18:10:17.352324+00:00', E'2b53d3d9-668c-49f8-803c-9504fb0ecfdf', E'4c02988e-e748-4fab-b0e4-fbcb50d063b9', null, E'e56c1ca9-bb2b-4205-8313-e5165a886bed');

It consists of a series of geometric patterns created using algorithms, reflecting Nake\'s exploration of the systematic and procedural nature of artistic creation through computational processes.\n\nVera Molnar was an artist known for being one of the first to use computers to generate geometric compositions. Molnár began working with computers in the late 1960s and continued pushing boundaries until her recent death in 2023.\n\n"Des Ordres" is a series of works where Molnar created tensions in an orthogonal structure, as if the squares were subject to a vibrating force, by drawing a pattern of concentric squares randomly disrupted in order to highlight the contrast between order and disorder.\n\nIn the 21st century, Molnár\'s work continues to serve as a source of inspiration and reference for generative artists. Her emphasis on the systematic and procedural nature of artistic creation resonates with contemporary artists who combine the potential of computational tools and techniques to generate artworks that are dynamic and ever-evolving.\n\nManfred Mohr began creating computer-generated art in the late 1960s. His work involves the use of mathematical algorithms to create intricate and visually striking compositions, demonstrating the aesthetic possibilities of computational processes.\n\nIn works like "P-280a", Mohr explored recursively the visual possibilities of geometric abstraction through algorithmic processes, creating linear compositions that reflect his fascination with mathematics and computational aesthetics.\n\nHarold Cohen is known for his creation of the AARON program, an artificial intelligence system designed to autonomously produce art. Cohen\'s work with AARON began in the late 1960s but continued to evolve throughout the digital revolution, demonstrating the potential of rule-based algorithmic systems to generate creative drawings and paintings.\n\nAARON generates paintings, drawings, and other visual compositions and combines color, form, and composition, producing works with a distinct figurative style much different from his contemporaries. Cohen\'s creation blurs the lines between machine and artist, sparking debate on creativity, AI, and the nature of art itself.\n\nGeorg Nees was a mathematician and computer scientist who is considered one of the earliest practitioners of computer-generated art. Nees began experimenting with algorithmic drawing programs in the early 1960s.\n\n"Schotter" is a seminal work by Nees that explores the visual potential of algorithmic art. It features a grid of randomly generated black squares arranged according to mathematical rules, reflecting Nees\' interest in the relationship between randomness and order in art.\n\nLillian Schwartz was an artist and computer scientist who began her career as a painter and sculptor but became fascinated by the potential of computers to create art in the 1960s. Schwartz\'s work focused on the creative possibilities of algorithms and computational processes through patterns and geometry.\n\nIn “Newtonian 1”, Schwartz created a film by algorithms to transform simple geometric shapes into complex and evolving patterns, exploring the visual potential of mathematical transformations and procedural techniques.\n\nJohn Whitney is an animator and filmmaker known for his groundbreaking work in computer animation during the 1960s and 1970s. He developed algorithms to create mesmerizing visual effects and abstract animations.\n\n"Catalog" is a groundbreaking experimental film by Whitney that showcases abstract geometric patterns animated using analog computers, demonstrating Whitney\'s innovative approach to motion graphics.\n\nJoan Truckenbrod began her career as a painter and printmaker but became fascinated by the creative potential of computers in the 1970s. Truckenbrod played with perception by focusing on the transformative possibilities of digital media.\n\nIn the 1970s, Truckenbrod worked in “coded algorithmic drawings” that through natural phenomena, like light waves or sound, helped her fluidly materialize ideas into forms she had in her mind.\n\nRoman Verostko is an artist who began exploring computer-generated imagery in the 1970s. Verostko\'s work often involves intricate patterns and calligraphic forms generated through algorithms.\n\n“Bird-2” shows the transition that Verostko had from traditional painter to code-based artist where he coded procedures developed into a series of routines that combined random procedures for "computer automatism" with procedures for the controlled placement of geometric elements in the same form field.\n\nMuriel Cooper was a designer and educator known for her innovative work in graphic design, typography, and information visualization. Cooper played a significant role in shaping the field of design during the latter half of the 20th century, particularly through her contributions to the development of digital design tools.\n\n"Information Landscapes" is an interactive multimedia project by Cooper that visualizes data in dynamic and immersive ways. It exemplifies her approach to information design and showcases her pioneering use of digital technologies in graphic design.\n\nWilliam Latham is an artist known for his work in evolutionary art and artificial life. Latham\'s computer programs generate organic and often surreal digital sculptures and images through simulated evolution.\n\n"The Evolution of Forms" uses genetic algorithms to evolve complex 3D forms.
