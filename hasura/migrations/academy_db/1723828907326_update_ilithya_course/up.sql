UPDATE courses SET description = 'This course is designed for beginners eager to dive into the world of computational thinking and creative coding with pixel shaders, also known as fragment shaders, in GLSL. While shaders may initially seem complex, this course will help you see them in a new light. Whether you\'re completely new to shaders or have hesitated to get started, we\’re here to guide you through every step.

Shaders don’t have to be intimidating—it’s all about how you approach and interpret them. We’ll turn those initial frustrations into \'aha\' moments, shining a light on what might have seemed like a dark tunnel. Let’s get started on this exciting journey together, and by the end, you’ll be creating stunning visual effects with confidence!' WHERE id = '5f1f6044-21ba-4409-880e-02cd36568697';
